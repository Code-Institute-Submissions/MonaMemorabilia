# Monachese Photography

The purpose of this site is to showcase an independent photographer's gallery, demonstrate their ability to digitally enhance photos, and to advertise photo 
sessions and editing packages to meet the photography needs of potential clients. A majority of the images showcased cater to parents and grandparents, however 
these also may appeal to a smaller market of young adults seeking business portraits and clients who wish to digitally enhance photographs.

# UX Choices
### Home
+ Shows off four eye-catching photos in bootstrap carousel
+ Gives a brief description of the general services offered in a responsive four box layout that makes use of negative space

### Main Nav
+ Includes a clean, responsive bootstrap nav bar
+ Provides a clear display of the company logo in top left corner

### Main Footer
+ Uses Fontawesome icons paired with text to display a contemporary social link design
+ Added social links that could be used by an independent photographer

### About Us
+ Features a Hero image which demonstrates the photographer’s ability to digitally enhance photos. One side of the photo is the original and has no editing, 
    while the other half shows the image after digital enhancement.
+ Features a no-frills text section which emphasizes the exceptional work offered by the company

### Gallery
+ Utilizes negative space to draw the eye to the four categories of sub-gallery image links
+ Images on the page include a *hover* and *scale* feature to provide the appearance of conventional links

### Sub-Galleries (all pages that are linked from within gallery)
+ Includes a back button to the main gallery and a two-way in-page nav for user convenience
+ All images have an added *border* and *box-shadow* to give a three-dimensional effect

### Contact us
+ Contains a simple submission form which prevents users from accidentally submitting without completing the contact information
+ The final box (Describe Your Session needs...) includes plenty of space for users to submit a substantial and well-thought out response

### Brand Identity
+ The headers (h1, h2…) *font-families* match the style of the logo
+ The main page color scheme uses the monochromatic coloration of the logo
+ The pictures used maintain themes of family, digital enhancement, and demonstrate the photographer’s artistic style

## Potential Client Examples
+ A: A client is uncertain of what type of photo service they are interested in 
    + Client sees the home page carousel and likes the business portrait. The client then describes their desire for business portrait 
        in the "Describe your session needs..." on Contact Us page
+ B: Client wants to schedule a session for their children with the photographer and have photos digitally enhanced 
    + The client sees the home page and decides to look at the children gallery. After client has looked through the children’s gallery 
        and the digital enhancement gallery, the client is ready to describe their photo needs in the contact submission form. They request 
        digital enhancement in addition to asking to book a photo session.
+ C: Has an idea for a photo session that does not fit into any standard photo session 
    + Home page has a section about custom projects and decides to reach out to photographer with an e-mail link found in the footer
+ D: Is looking for previously taken photos to be fixed from a previous photo editors poor work 
    + Client sees an artistic photo on the home page carousel they appreciate, decides to learn more about the independent photographer 
        and looks at the About Us section. After seeing the half-edited photograph, they decide to use the session inquiry from found on 
        the footer to submit a photo-enhancement project.

## Live Protype Demo and Wire Frame
+ An active prototype can be found [here](https://richardaeld.github.io/MonaMemorabilia/ "Web Page") at GitHub.
+ The wire frame PNG's can be found [here](https://github.com/Richardaeld/MonaMemorabilia/tree/master/assets/wireframe "Wire Frame") also embedded at GitHub.

# Testing
## Previous and Current Bugs
+ During the programming of this webpage, there were numerous graphical misalignments. These were primarily generated by Bootstrap creating 
    padding and margins and was the result of using rows and container-fluid commands. These were easily taken care of with appropriate padding 
    and margin removal and the use of "!important".
+ Various pages were not filling the entire screen on specific interface devices when using the inspect function in Chrome. By matching the 
    body’s default *background-color* to the footer’s *background-color*, it gives the illusion that the footer's *background-color* extends 
    to the bottom of the screen.
+ The file "Core.python3.2641.1592707923" will crash GitPod when attempting to delete it.
+ When viewing all sub-galleries at an i5 resolution in landscape (568px x 320px) while using the Chrome inspect function, the top and bottom 
    borders of photos cannot be seen due to the size of the nav bar and the physical limitations of the pixels on the screen.

## Not supported determined by Browserstack and version of Bootstrap
+ Internet explorer 9 and older
+ Opera 12.15 and older
+ Firefox 3.6 and older
+ Safari 8.0 and older

## Web Browsers that support transition effects used
+ Chrome 26.0 and newer
+ Internet explorer 10 and newer
+ Firefox 16 and newer
+ Safari 6.1 and newer
+ Opera 12.1 and newer

## Scalability
+ Adding a user operable slide-bar to change images from the original to an edited version could offer better representation on the digital 
    enhancement section and in the About Us section (This feature is outside the scope of this project)
+ The use of a modal in the sub-gallery pages would allow for pictures to pop up instead of relying on a clunky in-page nav
+ Changing *px* to *rem* in CSS would help reduce code length in CSS and add better responsiveness to all pages on smaller devices

## Web Programs used
+ Pingdom results can be found [here](https://github.com/Richardaeld/MonaMemorabilia/tree/master/assets/pingdom)
+ Browserstack results can be found [here](https://github.com/Richardaeld/MonaMemorabilia/tree/master/assets/browserstack)
+ W3C Validator was used to help identify errors in HTML and CSS

# Technologies
## Languages
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JS (with Bootstrap)
+ JQuery (with Bootstrap)

## Framework (Bootstrap not wire frame - balsmiq)
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The framework used to help structure this web page
+ [Balsmiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Helped produce the wireframe used for this web page

## Web-based tools
+ GitHub - Deployment of prototype site
+ GitPod - Integrated development environment
+ Pingdom - Checking for page load time
+ BrowserStack - Checking for platform incompatibility
+ TinyPNG - Minimizing KB load per image
+ Fontawesome - Icons used
+ Google fonts - Fonts used
+ Bootstrap - Used as framework
+ W3C Validator - Used to identify errors in code

## Web-based references and code used from
+ [webaccessibilitychecklist](http://webaccessibilitychecklist.com/) - Helped with making web page ARIA accessible
+ [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility) - Helped with understanding of when and how to use ARIA
+ [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped with fine-tuning CSS and provided examples of advanced tricks involving *transition*, *hover*, and *scale*. These can be seen in:
    1. Index (*Hover* button effects are found under "Custom Project" and *text-shadow* is used on the busisness name, Monachese Photography)
    2. Main footer(*Hover* effect used for the social media icons)
    3. Gallery and sub-galleries (All nav images use the *scale* effect and a *box-shadow*)
    4. Sub-galleries (The clickable images use a *scale* and *transition* effect. The other images use *box-shadow*)
- [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Helped in understanding how to correct visual bugs with Bootstrap's automatic padding and margins
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) -
  1. Main nav (Used responsive design nav bar)
  2. Index (Image carousel)
  3. Contact us (Form)
  4. Sub-Gallery(Scrollspy was used for the in-page nav and the "invisible" properity was used to hide placement of in-page nav snap-to points)
+ Code Institute (Class) - Used footer design based on the golden ratio and made social links like the examples shown in class
+ Used a visual reference from a classmate (Simon "jumboduck") for the About Us section. The idea that was used is a large Hero image followed by the golden 
    ratio of three text boxes that share the *background-color* of the page.
