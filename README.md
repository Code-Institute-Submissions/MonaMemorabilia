# Monachese Photography

This site allows a photographer's company to show off their brand and ability to digitally improve photos. The implied clientele is parents and grandparents, however this site
also applies to a smaller market of young adults seeking business portraits and those seeking to digitally improve previously taken photo's.

# Testing

# Previous and Current Bugs

Numerous graphical misalignments were experienced during the construction of this project.  These were primarily generated by bootstrap creating padding and margins with 
the use of rows and container-fluid commands. Thus they were easily taken care of with appropiate padding/margin removal and use of "!important".  

Another issue is the page not filling the entire page on specific interface devices. The fix used was giving the body a fall back color of the footer. Thus it appears the
footer just keeps extending to fill the page. 

The file "Core.python3.2641.1592707923" will crash gitpod when attempting to delete it.

# Scalability 

+ Photo slider to change photo from before digital editing to after (Would be neat but outside of scope of project)
+ Use of a modal in sub-gallery pages to pop up a picture rather than relying on a in page nav
