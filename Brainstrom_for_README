*--sales pitch--*

This page shows the value provided by a professional photographer with editing skills. By showcasing a variety of different photos, photo taking techniques, and editing effects this helps 
build a emotional value to product provided. With an obvious market of parents and grandparents applied to there is also others applied to: those wanting professional portraits taken, people
wanting their photo's(or a photo taken that can be) turned into a frameable work of art, and real estate landscape photos taken(due to scope of project not implimented yet).

This website showcases a single photographer's aptitude for being behind the lens of his camera and using visual editing software. 

The main focus of this photographer is the emotional value of personal family moments. This  

The art shown has family The main focus of this website is showcasing images that give emotional worth.    

There is a large focus on family photography to appeal to parents and grandparents alike.  To a lesser degree there are  


The focus of these photographs is mostly family portraits and children. There are other photographs that display a more artistic and formal side to this photographer. The family
and children sections of photos is for selling photos to parents and grandparents. The portrait section is for selling to busisness women/men for professional porfolios. Finally
the Digital Editing section is for selling artwork. The idea of this section is to appeal the largest clientel as possible. Changing a photo into a work of art is fairly simple
and should yeild a greater profit with the upsale of a picture frame.

The site is structured to give people a strong visual interest in the product being sold. With minimual use of text and an about us section that is about the user and improving
their experience. This helps make the potiental client curious about the product and makes them want to communicate with the company. The lack of pricing was a tactful choice to 
keep potiental clients from feeling like they cannot afford this service. This gives the site a chance to communicate as a person to person sales tactic.  The site may not make a 
sale everytime but it gives an oppertunity to negociate a price and attempt an upsale rather than immediately losing a customer.

## --existing features --

## --features left to implement --
*Photo slider to change photo from before digital editing to after (Would be neat but outside of scope of project)
*use of a modal in sub-gallery pages to pop up a picture rather than relying on a in page nav

## --technologies used--
***Check these
    **JS
    **JQuery
    **Believe bother are used with bootstraps carousel

## --testing --
*I use a 1920x1080 monitor in landscape and profile
    **Use inspect in chrome to check every preset responsiveness in both landscape and profile on both of my monitors.
*also use a projector with a browser zoom to help see and find visual problems

***Known problems include site not going to bottom of screen (ex: leaving white space below bottom of footer)

## --deployment--
*single git branch
*drawing of ideas on pen and paper  
*negative feed back from mentor lead to a total rewrite of webpage
*updates after rewrite focused on responsiveness and a more minimal approach to code
*numerous updates were based on image placement, reduction of image size(KB), standardization of image ratio(1200x800 or 800x1200), and finding images that "sold" the product
